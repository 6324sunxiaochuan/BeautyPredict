# BeautyPredict

Facial beauty prediction via deep learning methods based on SCUT-FBP5500 dataset described in the paper [1] and [2]ï¼Œwhich listed at the end of this article, have been partially implemented in this project.

The SCUT- FBP5500 dataset has totally 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) and diverse labels (face landmarks, beauty scores within [1, 5], beauty score distribution), which allows different computational models with different FBP paradigms.

Further more, three recently proposed CNN models with different structures for FBP, including AlexNet, ResNet-18 and ResNeXt-50, which are trained by initializing weights using networks pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, have been evaluated on the dataset.

The results illustrates that the deepest CNN-based ResNeXt-50 model obtains the best performance. [The Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) is 0.8997.

The second paper, recasts facial attractiveness computation as a label distribution learning problem and puts forward an end-to-end attractiveness learning framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on a standard benchmark, the SCUT-FBP dataset, where shows significant advantages over other state-of-the-art work.

I have trained a five layers CNN model and a Label distribution learning model based on ResNet fine-tuing. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.8 and 0.91 respectively, which is tested on the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset.
